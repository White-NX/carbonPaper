# Contribution Guidelines

## Before Start

First, you should clone the source code from the `main` branch. 

When you submit a PR, make sure it goes to the same branch where you originally pulled the code, and clearly explain what logic was added or modified and its effect.

## Start Contribution

To participate this project, you will need these tools:

1. Any kind of IDE.
2. Node.js v22.18.0 or later
3. python v3.12.10 (suggested)

Running this command before developing

```
npm install
```

## Apologies for the multilingual annotations

Due to oversights in early development, the program currently contains mixed Chinese and English comments, and lacks comprehensive API documentation. This issue will likely be addressed in future versions.
